After multiple unsuccessful attempts at getting myself to consistently produce
blog entries, I finally set out to follow [Jeff Attwood's advice][1] and set
myself a goal to publish one new blog article per month (or more).

I will be blogging about *software engineering*, *programming languages*,
*career*, and maybe also *photography* and other topics, as I see fit.

This blog currently does not include a comments section, but I do welcome
(constructive) feedback and am always glad to answer any questions that come my
way... Information on how to reach me is available in the [About](/#about)
section of the landing page &mdash; feel free to use it!
