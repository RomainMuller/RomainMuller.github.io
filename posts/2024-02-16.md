title: On the use of inclusive langague

During my last few years at Amazon, there's been a growing consideration for
<abbr title="Diversity, Equity and Inclusion">DEI</abbr> in the workplace, but
also in a lot of internal- and external-facing documents (marketing material,
product documentation, APIs, ...).

This put emphasis on certain widely used terms in the Computer Science field
which are increasingly considered problematic due to racist connotations they
convey, and called for the use of more inclusive substitutes. This includes
terms such as (this list does not even attempt to be exhaustive):

Problematic        {.table-dark} | Substitute                {.table-dark}
---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
master / slave   {.table-danger} | primary / replica      {.table-success}
brown bag        {.table-danger} | lunch and learn        {.table-success}
black-list       {.table-danger} | deny-list / block-list {.table-success}
white-list       {.table-danger} | allow-list / pass-list {.table-success}

{.table}

During my time at Amazon, I volunteered as an Inclusion Ambassador, meaning that
I was passionate about the subject of Diversity & Inclusion, and as such I ended
up being fairly vocal on the topic. I firmly believe that more diversity is
always a net positive, and there appears to be countless evidence of this being
the case... but how to achieve this is always the more difficult part.

When discussing problematic terminology with folks, it would appear that people
outside of the USA (where the conversation about inclusive phrasings has largely
originated) &ndash; and more generally people who are typically not part of
under-represented groups (and even mroe so, folks who aren't people of color)
&ndash; would often push back with one of the following arguments:

- These are _just words_ and people are trying to make them mean stuff they've
  never been meaning until recently;
- These phrasings have been used pervasively in Computer Science and are demmed
  _standard_ terminology with well accepted definitions, so they cannot be
  replaced that easily;
- This term (e.g, _blacklist_) predates the root of racist connotations by at
  least a century, so the claim of racist smell is invalid.

It's interesting that these push-backs always come from folks who typically are
not susceptible to be victims of racism in the sense that we mean it today,
especially (but not only) in the USA. And for this reason, it's usually a waste
of energy to try and provide arguments specifically aimed at debunking some of
these claims.

For example, the term _blacklist_ is ethymologically derived from the term
_black book_, which has been in use since the 1400's... So this is in fact
accurate that the term itself predates the racism it is claimed to be connotated
with today ([ref.][^1]). That fact is however in and of itself not sufficient to
actually void the racist connotation! Indeed, the fact the words were used
outside of a racist context does not prove that they were not _later_ (ab)used
to exercise racism.

The term _brown bag_ (colloqually referring to a meeting held at or close to
lunch time, during which people are allowed or encouraged to have lunch) refers
to the brown-colored paper bags in which folks may bring their lunch. It was
however also used as a complexion reference in racist America &mdash; if your
skin was darker than the bag, you were denied entry ([ref.][^2]).

So instead of entering the sterile argument game, I find it is a lot more
effective to question what exactly is the difficulty with replacing occurrences
of certain words with another... As this usually amounts to a trivial
search-and-replace operation that can often be done in a matter of a couple of
minutes. And with respects to well-accepted definitions, it sometimes is very
stright forward... The first time I received a calendar invite for a
_"brown bag"_, I had to ask "what the hell is this?"... Now... a
_lunch and learn_? I immediately get the idea that I'll be having lunch while at
the same time learning something new (what's not to love about that?).

At the core, it matters not whether I relate or agree with the perceptions of
other humans who think _master_ has racist connotations (in particular when not
paired with _slave_)... I am **not** part of a group that has historically been
victim of slavery or racist slurs... As a member of a pretty wildly privileged
group (cis-gender white dudes), I think it is my duty to act on behalf of those
with less privilege, and so I will always side with the victims, and insist
inclusive terminology is used... After all, it is a trivial price to pay.
