# About Me

My name is Romain Marcadier, and *Orderly RAM* is my blog about software
engineering, open-source, and more...

## Background

I was born in France, and have been married to my husband since 2014.

## Career

I'm a *Senior Software Development Engineer* at Amazon Web Services, working on open-source software
as part of the  [AWS <abbr title="Cloud Development Kit">CDK</abbr>][aws-cdk] project, in particular
[`jsii`](https://github.com/aws/jsii) &mdash; the technology that backs CDK's cross-language
functionality.

I've been doing software engineering at Amazon for <time datetime="PT14Y">14 years</time> at this
point, and before working on the AWS CDK team, I worked on Amazon's european sales & operations
planning software, semi-automated locatization of product detail pages between Amazon's european
marketplaces, and building custom-made business intelligence solutions for Amazon's global last-mile
operations.

## Education

I studied Computer Science and Software Engineering, starting with a
<abbr title="Diplome Universitaire de Technologie">DUT</abbr> (a two-year undergraduate diploma
similar to what is issued by vocational/technical schools in the US) in Computer Sciences from the
[<abbr title="Institut Universitaire de Technologie">IUT</abbr> in Metz (France)][iut-metz] in 2005,
during which I took an elective on _functional programming and Lambda-calculus_, which used OCaml as
the language of choice for labs.

Following this, I joined [Télécom Nancy][telecom-nancy], a public engineering school based in Nancy
(France), where I obtained a Masters engineering degree in *Computer Sciences* with a major in
*Software Engineering* in 2008.
